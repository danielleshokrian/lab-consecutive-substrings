Define function consecutiveSubstrings with input of string

Result is the empty list where I will add my letter combinations
to after it has successfully looped.

The string is like an array and for every letter in that array
loop through from an index of 'i', until you have reached end of word, or length of the string

    For each letter in the array, loop through from index of 'j' from 'i+1' 
    until end of string, or length of string:
        Extract the shorter string from index i up to but not including index j
        Append the shorter string to result

Return result



This function takes a string, loops through the string (the index decides where it starts)
and pairs it with the rest of the word after, and also loops within that word
to see where the substring ends. The slice tool cuts the piece of the string and 
tells the function where to start and end. After going through all possible start and end combinations, 
return the list of all substrings.
